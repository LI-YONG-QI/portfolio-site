# Aave Liquidation Mechanism

When a position’s Health Factor drops below 1, it becomes eligible for liquidation. The Health Factor is calculated as:

$$
Health Factor = \frac{\text{Total Collateral Value} \times \text{Weighted Average Liquidation Threshold}}{\text{Total Borrow Value}}
$$

The liquidation threshold is determined through Aave governance and varies for each asset (typically based on its risk profile). For example, if a user deposits \$10,000 worth of ETH with an 80% liquidation threshold and borrows \$6,000 worth of GHO, their Health Factor would be:

$$
\frac{10,000 \times 0.8}{6,000} = 1.333
$$

As the Health Factor approaches 1, the risk of liquidation increases.

Liquidation is permissionless — anyone can liquidate an unhealthy position. When liquidation occurs, the liquidator repays either 50% or 100% of the borrower's debt. Additionally, the borrower incurs a liquidation penalty on their collateral.

---

# Calculation Details

When calculating liquidation eligibility, the current Health Factor determines the liquidation ratio:

- If `0.95 < Health Factor < 1`, only **50%** of the borrower's debt can be repaid.
- If `Health Factor ≤ 0.95`, then **100%** of the debt can be repaid.

During liquidation, the liquidator repays the borrower’s debt to claim their collateral. Additionally, a liquidation bonus is granted as a reward for the liquidator. So, the borrower's total loss equals:

$$
\text{Collateral Lost} = \text{Debt Repaid} + \text{Liquidation Bonus}
$$

The liquidator’s profit:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Liquidation Bonus} - \text{Protocol Fee} - \text{Gas Costs}
$$

The liquidation bonus varies by asset and is also determined by Aave governance.

# Liquidation Execution

As liquidation is permissionless, anyone can trigger it by calling the `liquidationCall()` function on the `Pool` contract. Liquidators can monitor on-chain positions for unhealthy Health Factors and execute liquidation when conditions are met.

To perform liquidation, the liquidator must have sufficient assets to repay the borrower's debt. If the borrower has multiple collateral types — e.g., A, B, and C tokens — backing a loan of token D, the liquidator can choose **any one collateral type** to repay against, as long as its value covers the liquidation amount.

For example:
If a borrower has:

- A token: \$20
- B token: \$100
- C token: \$200

Borrowed: \$100 of D token

A liquidator can choose to use \$100 worth of A token to repay, seize the corresponding A token collateral (plus bonus), and typically picks the collateral with the highest liquidation bonus.

---

# Safety Module

**Bad debt is covered by the Safety Module.**

In cases where collateral price drops too quickly for liquidators to react, resulting in bad debt, Aave’s Safety Module is designed to cover the shortfall. Token holders can stake **AAVE**, **GHO**, or **ABPT** tokens to secure the protocol.

If a shortfall occurs, staked tokens from the Safety Module are slashed to repay the debt. Stakers receive AAVE rewards as compensation, and the reward parameters are governed by Aave’s DAO.

When staking, users receive staking certificates (stkAAVE / stkABPT) as proof of deposit.

---

# Price Oracle

To verify collateralization and Health Factors, Aave uses USD-based external price feeds from **Chainlink Oracles**. Chainlink is highly accurate and reliable, and is a preferred choice for many DeFi protocols.

Whenever borrow, repay, or liquidation operations occur, the Pool contract queries the Chainlink Oracle for the latest prices to check if positions qualify for liquidation.

# Interest Rate Model

## Borrowing Rate

Aave’s interest rate model uses a **piecewise function** (not a simple linear one). The rate increases slowly until it reaches an **Optimal Utilization Rate (e.g., 90%)**, beyond which it rises sharply.
**Utilization** $U$ is calculated as:

$$
U = \frac{\text{Borrowed}}{\text{Borrowed} + \text{Free Deposits}}
$$

Where:

- **Borrowed** = funds already loaned out
- **Free Deposits** = unused supplied funds

At utilization rates above the optimal point (90%), the borrow rate increases rapidly to discourage over-borrowing and reduce bank-run risk.

Aave’s piecewise rate formula:

$$
R_{\text{borrow}} =
\begin{cases}
R_{\text{intercept}} + \frac{U}{U_{\text{optimal}}} \times R_{\text{slope1}}, & U \le U_{\text{optimal}} \\
R_{\text{intercept}} + R_{\text{slope1}} + \frac{U - U_{\text{optimal}}}{1 - U_{\text{optimal}}} \times R_{\text{slope2}}, & U > U_{\text{optimal}}
\end{cases}
$$

Where:

- $R_{\text{borrow}}$: Current borrow rate
- $R_{\text{intercept}}$: Base rate (set by governance)
- $R_{\text{slope1}}$: Rate slope before optimal utilization
- $R_{\text{slope2}}$: Rate slope after optimal utilization

**Diagram:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/irIoBFh.png)

The chart illustrates the rate behavior before and after the optimal utilization point (e.g. 90%).

## Use Case

Given:

$$
R_{\text{intercept}} = 0
$$

$$
R_{\text{slope1}} = 0.04
$$

$$
R_{\text{slope2}} = 0.75
$$

$$
U_{\text{optimal}} = 0.80
$$

- If $U = 20\%$

$$
R_{\text{borrow}} = 0 + \frac{20}{80} \times 0.04 = 0.01
$$

Borrow rate = **1%**

- If $U = 90\%$

$$
R_{\text{borrow}} = 0 + 0.04 + \frac{0.90-0.80}{1-0.80} \times 0.75 = 0.04 + \frac{0.10}{0.20} \times 0.75 = 0.04 + 0.375 = 0.415
$$

Borrow rate = **41.5%**

---

## Supply Rate

Once the borrow rate is calculated, the supply rate is derived simply by multiplying the borrow rate by utilization:

$$
R_{\text{deposits}} = R_{\text{borrow}} \times U
$$

This ensures all borrower-paid interest is fairly distributed to depositors (excluding protocol fees).

**Example:**

- 10 users deposit 1 ETH each (total 10 ETH)
- 5 ETH is borrowed at a 20% interest rate ($U=50\%$)
- 5 ETH borrowed generates 1 ETH in interest
- 1 ETH interest divided across 10 ETH → each ETH earns 0.1 ETH → 10% supply rate

Formula check:

$$
10\% = 20\% \times 50\%
$$

# AToken

When a user deposits tokens, they receive **aTokens** (e.g. aETH) representing interest-bearing positions. aTokens are pegged 1:1 to the underlying asset.
They allow users to freely transfer yield-bearing positions without withdrawing the actual asset — similar to Uniswap v3 position NFTs.

### aToken Interest Accumulation

Aave updates aToken balances **in real time** by overriding the ERC20 `balanceOf()` function:

1. Fetches user’s raw stored balance from a mapping
2. Multiplies it by the **Liquidity Index**
3. Returns the updated balance

The Liquidity Index increments every time a transaction affecting reserves occurs: `supply`, `borrow`, `repay`, `withdraw`, `liquidate`.

- Index starts at 1.0
- It increases cumulatively over time

$$
\text{Index}_{a,n} = \text{Index}_{a,n-1} \times (1 + r \times t)
$$

### Use Case

Assuming historical annual interest rates:

| Month   | Annual Rate |
| :------ | :---------- |
| Month 1 | 12%         |
| Month 2 | 6%          |
| Month 3 | 8%          |

**Liquidity Index Calculation:**

| Month          | Liquidity Index                        |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| End of Month 1 | $1 \times (1 + 0.12/12) = 1.01$        |
| End of Month 2 | $1.01 \times (1 + 0.06/12) = 1.0105$   |
| End of Month 3 | $1.0105 \times (1 + 0.08/12) = 1.0113$ |

If a user deposits 10 ETH at the start:

| Month          | Balance                                 |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| End of Month 1 | $10 \times 1.01 = 10.1$ ETH             |
| End of Month 2 | $10.1 \times 1.0105 = 10.20105$ ETH     |
| End of Month 3 | $10.20105 \times 1.0113 = 10.31345$ ETH |

# Code Architecture

**Smart Contract System Diagram:**

![](https://i.imgur.com/pZePeM1.png)

### Pool

The core contract for every Aave market. Each token market (e.g. ETH, USDC) has its own Pool contract, responsible for:

- `supply()` → mints aTokens
- `withdraw()` → burns aTokens
- `borrow()`, `repay()`, `liquidate()`, etc.

### PoolAddressesProvider

Handles the configuration for the Pool contract:

- Manages ACL roles
- Links to the active Price Oracle
- Supports Pool contract upgrades (upgradeable proxy pattern)

### PoolAddressesProviderRegistry

Maps Pools to their corresponding `PoolAddressesProvider` using a mapping structure.

### ACLManager

Access control contract based on OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl — defines multiple roles for protocol administration and risk management.
