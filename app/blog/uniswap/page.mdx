# Comparison with v2

In v2, the formula:

$$
x \cdot y = k
$$

is used to calculate the pool's liquidity, reserves, and price via the ratio of x and y. Liquidity is provided **globally**, meaning it covers the entire price range. No matter the market price, there's always liquidity available, avoiding token depletion.

In v3, users can **concentrate liquidity within specific price ranges** to improve capital efficiency. This requires major changes in liquidity calculation, as a single global `k` constant no longer applies.

## Providing Liquidity in a Specific Range

In v3, liquidity can be provided within specified ranges, called **positions** — stored as NFTs. As long as the market price is within the range, LPs collect fees.

![Figure2](https://i.imgur.com/dCkrpsp.png)

When price moves out of range, the position becomes inactive and can't collect fees. If liquidity is withdrawn, it will be in a **single token**.

When price reaches a boundary (e.g. P2), the position's token B is exhausted — it can't provide market making beyond this point.

## Price & Liquidity Calculations

v3 only stores:

- $\sqrt P$ — square root of price ($\sqrt{y/x}$)
- $L$ — liquidity, $x \cdot y = k = L^2$

From $x \cdot y = k$:

- $x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} L$
- $y = \sqrt{P} L$

Prices are expressed in **ticks**:

- $p(i) = 1.0001^i$
- $\sqrt{p(i)} = 1.0001^{i/2}$
- $\log_{1.0001}{(p)} = i$

## Liquidity

In v2, liquidity depends on reserves with a 50/50 value ratio.

In v3:

- Each position has price bounds.
- The pool’s total liquidity is a collection of these positions.

### LP Use Case

From Figure 3:

- $\Delta y = \Delta \sqrt{P} L$ (f1)
- $\Delta x = \Delta \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} L$ (f2)

Further:

- $\Delta y = (\sqrt{P} - \sqrt{P2}) L$
- $\Delta x = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{P1}}) L$

Finally:

$$
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = (\sqrt{P} - \sqrt{P2}) \times \frac{\sqrt{P} \cdot \sqrt{P1}}{\sqrt{P1} - \sqrt{P}}
$$

**Example:**

- $p = 2645$
- $p1 = 2998$
- $p2 = 1000$

Result: $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \approx 16779$ — providing 1 y requires 16779 x.

> _Note: Solidity uses ticks and Q64.96 fixed-point (sqrtPriceX96). On-chain results may differ._

## Price

Swap flow without crossing ticks:

1. Specify **input or output amount**
2. Use pool’s $L$ and token amount to compute $\Delta P$
3. Compute corresponding token change

From (f1) and (f2):

- $\Delta \sqrt{P} = \frac{\Delta y}{L}$ (f4)
- $\Delta \frac{1}{\sqrt{P}} = \frac{\Delta x}{L}$ (f5)

**Example:** Adding 10 y in a $L=100$ pool:

- $\Delta \sqrt{P} = 0.1$
- $\sqrt{P_t} = \sqrt{P_c} + 0.1$

Then:

$$
\Delta x = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{P_t}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_c}}) L
$$

Result: $\Delta x \approx 0.236$

## UI Example

**Figure 5:** USDT/ETH pool UI

![Figure5](https://i.imgur.com/LMpDPt3.png)

Current price: 3632, range: 2195~6620. Fixing 1 ETH requires 3188 USDT.

Adjusting price range (Figure 6) increases required USDT as range widens.

# Contract Architecture

## Uniswap Overview

Universal Router manages both v2 and v3 swaps.

![Uniswap Universal Router](https://i.imgur.com/0ogynpW.png)

### Universal Router

Acts like a multicall, bundling operations via bytes-encoded instructions. The frontend picks optimal paths and parameters.

## V3 Core

Minimal contract architecture (production uses Universal Router).

![V3 Core](https://i.imgur.com/tvMJuiS.png)

### PoolFactory

Creates pools and assigns ownership.

### Pool

Handles:

- `mint` — add a position, mint NFT
- `burn` — remove liquidity, burn NFT
- `swap` — execute token swaps
- `collect` — collect earned fees

## Periphery

Helper contracts.

### SwapRouter

Handles swap logic with exactInput / exactOutput.

### NFTManager

ERC-721 implementation for position NFTs with functions like `collect`, `increaseLiquidity`, `decreaseLiquidity`.
